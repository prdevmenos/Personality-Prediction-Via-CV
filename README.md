In this project we use libraries of python like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
Numpy is used in this project to provide arrays because it is 50 times faster than the python lists.
Here pandas are used in the project to deal with the large datasets to easily read and perform the operations on it.
Matplotlib is used to plot the data in graph to get easily understand and analyze.
Seaborn is used to plot and visualize the data in random distributions to operate on dataframes and arrays containing large datasets.
re is used in the project to make regular expressions of the data.
sklearn(Scikit-learn) library is used mainly for training the model that are used like preprocessing, feature-extraction and model-selection kinds of methods or algorithms are implemented in the project.
Pickle module is used in the project to load the trained classifier is a way to convert a python object into character stream.
Streamlit library is used to create a webapp.
nltk(Natural Language Processing Toolkit) is language processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, labeling, and semantic reasoning. this all makes the application to allow computer to comprehend the natural language and responf appropriately when app is in use.
